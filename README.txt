Knit Stitch Counter

May 2024

Using buttons, a gyroscope, LEDs, a buzzer, a pressure sensor and an OLED screen,
this device is meant as a tool to aid knitters. It can keep track of the amount 
of stitches knit and record a pattern for the user so that the user can knit freely 
without counting. 

In the folder, you can find the circuit schematic and the pcb designs as well as
the 3D model used as a case to wear the board on your writs. 

The Arduino code programs an SAMD21 microchip.
